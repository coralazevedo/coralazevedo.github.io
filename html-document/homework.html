<p>Many web designers today are saying that web design is too complicated now and there are too many tools and programs to learn. When responsive design became popular, people soon complained that it was too challenging. In the earlier years of the web, there were many different browsers that supported different formats and different sized monitors. Designers usually designed for a single format. Now, there are different devices with different formatting and designers have to consider this when designing.</p>

<p>People are saying that coding has become too difficult, but pure code has never really been easy and hasn't changed dramatically through the years. HTML5 has brought a few new beneficial updates for designing. It isn't really "harder" or more to know because they are small changes that bring great benefits in designing systems rather than pages. Designers shouldn't feel like their knowledge of HTML and CSS isn't enough and need to know other programs and tricks to be successful. Pure HTML and CSS is all you need and those will never change.</p>
