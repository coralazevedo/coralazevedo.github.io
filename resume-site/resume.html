<h1 id="about-me">About Me</h1>
<p class="bio">Hey there!</p>
<p class="bio">
I'm Coral Azevedo, a Boston area based artist. I spend my free time working out, cooking and photographing vegan food, headbanging, and carefully applying winged eyeliner. I've learned everything I know about life from hard work, Star Wars, and being unfortunately accident prone (which I am currently writing a book about). Oh, I'm also a Graphic Designer.
</p>
<p class="bio">
I've known I wanted to be a designer since I was 15 years old. I went to a vocational high school and started my art and design education in the 9th grade. I then went on to study Fine Arts with a concentration in Graphic Design at Montserrat College of Art.
</p>

<p class="bio">
My work is very minimalistic and I often mix typefaces and use pops of color. I take inspiration from the ocean and nautical design, plants and animals, and Swiss design.
